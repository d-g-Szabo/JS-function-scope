# JS-function-scope
Function Scope:
We've looked at how we can use functions to break code up into smaller, reusable pieces. We've also looked at how to use functions to receive data as arguments, and return data as a result.

Function code blocks also have access to the variables defined outside of the function, in the parent code block. This is called "scope". The scope of the variable is the area of code where that value is available. Outside of that scope it might as well not exist.
